# MCiobi

The project is an implementation of the board game "Twixt" using C++ and the Qt framework.

Besides the basic game it also includes:

- a recommendation system that can help each player make the best move at a given moment. At the request of the player the AI uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to determine the most advantageous move the player can make to win.

- save game functionality

- load game functionality

- the board size, number of pieces and the number of simulations the AI does to provide the recommendations are configurable.

Menu: 

<img src = "twixt-project/Screenshots/Menu.png" alt = "menu ss" title = "Menu" width = "350" height = "350">

Game window: 
<img src = "twixt-project/Screenshots/GameWindow.png" alt = "game window ss" title = "Game Window" width = "350" height = "350">

Example of recommendation:
